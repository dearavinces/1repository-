##  My Favorite Math Formulas  

### 1. Vieta’s Theorem

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + x_2 = -\frac{b}{a} \\
x_1 x_2 = \frac{c}{a}
\end{cases}
$$

This formula connects the roots of a quadratic equation with its coefficients.

### 2. Area of a Circle

$$
S = \pi r^2
$$

This formula is used to find the area of a circle, where *r* is the radius and *π* is approximately 3.14159.

---

### 3. Area of a Triangle
$$
S = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot h
$$

It is used to find the area of a triangle using its base and height.

##  My Coding Skills  

Here is a simple C++ program that prints Hello, GitHub!:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, GitHub!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
 Check the program here: [C++ Compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
